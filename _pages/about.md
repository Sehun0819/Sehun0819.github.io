I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at UNIST, affiliated with the Software Testing and Analysis Research Lab under the supervision of Professor [Mijung Kim](https://mijungk.github.io/). My research focuses on software validation, leveraging both dynamic and static program analysis techniques to improve software reliability and security.
